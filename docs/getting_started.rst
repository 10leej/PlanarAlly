Getting Started (Players)
==========================

This document will show you how to get started using Planar Ally as a player.
To get to know the DM side of PA another document is available over :ref:`getting_started_dm:here`.

Installation?
-------------

When you are a player you won't need to install anything in order to use Planar Ally.
Your DM will either need to install the software himself or use a public/private provider.

Either way, your DM will have to give you the URL of the hosting he/she chose.
When you visit this URL you should be greeted with a login/registration form like shown below.

If you already have an account, you simply fill in your username and password and press enter
or the right pointing arrow.  If you are a new user, choose your desired username and password
and click on the + button.

.. note::
    If you use Planar Ally for multiple campaigns it's possible that they are played
    on multiple providers and you'll need to create an account on each specific provider.


Sessions
-------------

After logging in you'll be shown a landing page.

Here an overview of your active sessions is shown.
The first three sessions in the example above are DM'd by the active user.
Whereas the last one is DM'd by a user named frederik.

Creating a new session is straightforward but meant for DM's,
for more information check out the DM guide.

.. note::
    At the time of writing, the account settings page is not yet functional.

Joining a session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To join a specific session, you need the invite link.
Your DM should provide this to you.

When visiting this link, you'll automatically join the session and in a future visit
to the sessions page it should be listed as well.

The game
---------

When we finally are in the right session, the magic can begin!
