Getting Started (Players)
==========================

This document will show you how to get started using Planar Ally as a player.
To get to know the DM side of PA another document is available over :ref:`here <getting_started_dm>`.

Installation?
-------------

When you are a player you won't need to install anything in order to use Planar Ally.
Your DM will either need to install the software himself or use a public/private provider.

Either way, your DM will have to give you the URL of the hosting he/she chose.
When you visit this URL you should be greeted with a login/registration form like shown below.

If you already have an account, you simply fill in your username and password and press enter
or the right pointing arrow.  If you are a new user, choose your desired username and password
and click on the + button.

.. note::
    If you use Planar Ally for multiple campaigns it's possible that they are played
    on multiple providers and you'll need to create an account on each specific provider.


Session hub
-------------

After logging in you'll be shown a landing page.

.. image:: images/sessions.png

Here an overview of your active sessions is shown.
The first three sessions in the example above are DM'd by the active user.
Whereas the last one is DM'd by a user named frederik.

Creating a new session is straightforward but meant for DM's,
for more information check out the DM guide.

.. note::
    At the time of writing, the account settings page is not yet functional.

Joining a session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To join a specific session, you need the invite link.
Your DM should provide this to you.

When visiting this link, you'll automatically join the session and in a future visit
to the session hub it should be listed as well.

The game
---------

When we finally are in the right session, the magic can begin!

We'll start of with a short introduction of what happens when you open your first session,
followed by information on the various controls, tools and settings that you can configure.

First impressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upon loading the session, you'll be greeted with whatever your DM has prepared for you.
Let's take a look at an example where the DM has added a base map, added a token and some light/shadows.

.. image:: images/player-base.png

Most important UI elements are immediately visible.  We have a button in the topleft that opens a settings menu when pressed,
in the topright there is a slider that controls your zoom level and in the lower right there is a selection of tools that you can use.

We'll give a brief overview of these UI elements soon, there is however another UI element that is currently not visible!

When you select a token that you own, a red border will be drawn around the token to visually give a reminder of what you have selected and on top of that
a box appears at the right side of the screen, with the name of the selected token as well as any tracker or aura active on the token (more on that later).

.. image:: images/player-selection.png

This is a quick info panel for your token.  A more advanced view is possible by pressing on the edit button in this panel (in the topright).
This panel provides all the options to configure how your token(s) interact with the map.

Controls
~~~~~~~~~

One of the things you'll be doing most is almost certainly going to be moving around.
Getting to know the controls is thus an important element.

Most input is mouse based, but we'll first see some handy keyboard movement options.

Keyboard
^^^^^^^^^

If nothing is selected, using the arrow keys will result in moving the map in the desired direction.
When you've selected a token however, the token itself will move.

.. hint::
    These movements are always 1 grid cell wide, making them ideal for movement during combat.

Pressing `Delete` will delete the current selected token.

Pressing `d` will deselect your current selection.

mouse
^^^^^^

The left and right mouse button behaviour depends completely on the active tool,
the middle mouse button however has the same functionality at all times.

Scrolling will zoom in (or out) to the location where your mouse is currently pointing.

.. note::

    This scrolling behaviour differs from that of the slider,
    which will always focus on the center of the screen.

.. warning::

    Be careful with zooming out to far and then moving around.
    It's easy to lose the battlefield and get lost in the infinity of the void!
    
    Tools to find your path back to reality are in development,
    in the meanwhile you'll have to beg your DM to bring you back.

Pressing (and holding) the middle mouse button additionaly serves as a shortcut for the pan tool.
This is a tool that you'll often use and it would be a hassle to change tools every single time.

.. hint::

    Using the middle mouse button to pan means that you'll be spending less time using the UI and thus
    have more time to play the game!

Tools

Now then a quick overview of the various tools you can use.
