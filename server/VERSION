0.24.0

Due to a bugfix with zoom for non-default gridsizes, you will likely encounter your first load on a map to be slightly off centered
from where you had your camera last time. This should normally not be far off from the original location.
If you have issues finding your stuff back try the space bar to center on your tokens or ctrl+0 to go to the world center.
If you still have issues contact me and I can give you some console code.

### Added

-   Pressing the Enter button on a single selection will open the edit dialog for that shape
-   Hexagon support (flat and pointy topped)
-   Navigate viewport with numpad, 5 will center viewport on origin; tokens can be moved (behaviour depending whether grid is square, flat-top-hex or pointy-topped-hex) with numpad
-   Remove button to initiative effects
-   Map tool now has a (un)lock aspect ratio system
-   Map tool can now skip selection to resize the entire map at once (both in terms of gridd cells and in terms of pixels)
-   Import/Export capabilities to the asset manager
-   Multiruler support
    -   Pressing space while in the ruler tool will start a new ruler from your lastpoint
